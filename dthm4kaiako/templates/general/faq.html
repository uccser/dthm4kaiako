            <h5>Why was this website built?</h5>
            <p>
                This website was built to support Digital Technology and Hangarau Matihiko educators throughout New Zealand.
                We have seen the need for a specialised resource hub for this area, plus a central space for community and professional development opportunities.
                We have been planning this website since 2011, and were available to bring this to reality in 2017.

            <h5>How do I share my own resources?</h5>
            <p>
                Currently resources are only uploaded from the DTHM for kaiako team.
                We plan to add the ability for anyone to upload resources at a later date.
